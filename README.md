It includes the DHTesp.h and HTTPServer.h libraries. These libraries provide the functionality for reading the temperature and humidity from a DHT22 sensor and for creating an HTTP server.
It defines a constant for the DHT sensor pin. In this case, the DHT sensor is connected to pin 15 on the Arduino.
It creates a DHTesp object and a HTTPServer object. The DHTesp object is used to read the temperature and humidity from the sensor, and the HTTPServer object is used to create an HTTP server.
In the setup() function, it initializes the serial port and the DHT sensor. It also initializes the HTTP server and listens for connections on port 80.
In the loop() function, it checks for new sensor readings. If there are new readings, it gets the temperature and humidity data and sends it to the client. It then waits for 2000 milliseconds before checking for new readings again.
The handleRoot() function is called when a client makes a GET request to the root path of the server. This function gets the sensor data and sends it back to the client.
